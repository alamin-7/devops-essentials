# git rebase

 Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit

# git pull --rebase origin master

This command will make commit on top of the remote commit. In simple words, my local commits will be

placed first then the remote commits.  'A' 'B' 'C' [local] 'X' 'Y' 'Z' [remote]

#  git reflog

Git keeps a reflog, which is a log of all changes to the branches in your repository. 
You can use the reflog to find lost commits or changes
